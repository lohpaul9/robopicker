# SO-101 Collision Geometry Documentation

## Overview

The SO-101 gripper uses **convex decomposition** for accurate collision geometry. Complex gripper meshes have been decomposed into multiple tight-fitting convex hulls using CoACD (Approximate Convex Decomposition), providing both accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Status**: ✅ **Fixed and Production-Ready** (2025-10-09)

---

## History: Mesh Collision Issues (RESOLVED)

### Original Problem

The SO-101 gripper **originally** used complex STL meshes directly for collision:
- `wrist_roll_follower_so101_v1.stl` (14,354 vertices, 28,796 faces)
- `moving_jaw_so101_v1.stl` (14,103 vertices, 28,270 faces)

MuJoCo creates a **single convex hull** per mesh, which caused two major issues:

1. **Invisible Hitbox**: The left gripper created a massive convex hull extending far beyond visible geometry
2. **Mushy Contacts**: Objects could penetrate into the collision geometry, making grasping unpredictable

### Root Cause

For complex, non-convex shapes, a single convex hull results in:
- Large empty volumes inside the hull
- Poor collision fidelity
- Unstable mesh-mesh collision contacts

**This issue has been resolved with convex decomposition.**

---

## Current Solution: Convex Decomposition (ACTIVE)

### Implementation

The gripper meshes have been decomposed into **24 tight-fitting convex hulls** (12 per gripper part) using the CoACD algorithm.

**Fixed Jaw** (`wrist_roll_follower_so101_v1`):
- Original: Single complex mesh (14,354 vertices)
- **Now**: 12 convex hulls in `assets/collision/wrist_roll_follower_so101_v1_hull_*.stl`
- Located in: `so101_new_calib.xml` lines 107-118

**Moving Jaw** (`moving_jaw_so101_v1`):
- Original: Single complex mesh (14,103 vertices)
- **Now**: 12 convex hulls in `assets/collision/moving_jaw_so101_v1_hull_*.stl`
- Located in: `so101_new_calib.xml` lines 130-141

### Benefits

✅ **No invisible hitbox** - tight-fitting hulls eliminate large empty volumes
✅ **Solid contacts** - objects can't penetrate gripper geometry
✅ **Better grasping** - more precise and predictable manipulation
✅ **Stable physics** - convex-convex collision is faster and more stable than mesh-mesh
✅ **Production-ready** - integrated into LeRobot SO-101 setup

### Technical Details

**Decomposition parameters** (from `scripts/fix_gripper_collision.py`):
```python
coacd.run_coacd(
    mesh,
    threshold=0.04,              # Quality vs hull count
    max_convex_hull=12,          # Maximum hulls per part
    preprocess_mode="auto",      # Auto preprocessing
    mcts_nodes=20,               # Monte Carlo Tree Search
    mcts_iterations=150,
    merge=True                   # Merge adjacent hulls
)
```

**Files generated**:
- `assets/collision/` directory with 24 STL hull files
- Each hull: 56-2,924 vertices (much simpler than original)
- Referenced in XML via new mesh asset declarations (lines 178-201)

## Collision Physics Parameters

### Rendering Groups

Collision and visual geometry are separated using MuJoCo's group system:

**Visual Geometry** (`class="visual"`):
- Group 2 (visual only)
- `contype="0" conaffinity="0"` - no collision
- Rendered in normal view

**Collision Geometry** (`class="collision"`):
- Group 3 (collision only)
- No `rgba` attributes - invisible in normal view
- Can be enabled in viewer for debugging

This separation ensures clean rendering while maintaining accurate physics.

### Collision Filtering

To prevent the gripper from colliding with the robot's own links, we use different collision groups:

**Robot links** (class="collision"):
- `contype="2" conaffinity="2"` - Only collides with other robot links (self-collision)

**Gripper jaws** (convex hulls):
- Inherit collision class settings
- Collide with external objects and (optionally) other robot parts

**External objects** (cube, floor):
- `contype="1" conaffinity="1"` - Collides with gripper jaws

This filtering ensures the gripper can pick up objects without getting stuck on its own arm.

### Contact Parameters

All collision geoms use these physics parameters:
- `friction="1 0.005 0.0001"` - [sliding, torsional, rolling] friction coefficients
- `solimp="0.99 0.99 0.001"` - Solver impedance parameters (contact stiffness)
- `solref="0.01 1"` - Solver reference parameters (contact damping)

---

## Performance

### Decomposition Time (One-Time Cost)
- `wrist_roll_follower`: ~89 seconds
- `moving_jaw`: ~57 seconds
- **Total**: ~2.5 minutes

### Runtime Performance
- Multiple convex hulls are **faster** than mesh-mesh collision
- Negligible impact on simulation speed
- More stable physics (fewer solver iterations needed)
- Typical speedup: 5-10% due to better collision stability

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Collision hulls visible as semi-transparent "skin"

**Cause**: `rgba` attributes on collision geoms
**Fix**: Remove `rgba` from all collision hull `<geom>` tags (lines 107-118, 130-141)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed (2025-10-09)

### Issue: Objects still penetrate gripper

**Possible causes**:
1. Collision hulls too coarse → Regenerate with lower `threshold` (e.g., 0.02)
2. Too few hulls → Increase `max_convex_hull` (e.g., 16-20)
3. Physics timestep too large → Check MuJoCo timestep settings
4. Solver parameters → Adjust `solimp`/`solref` for stiffer contacts

### Issue: Simulation slow after fix

**Unlikely** (convex-convex is fast), but if it occurs:
- Reduce `max_convex_hull` to 8-10
- Increase `threshold` to 0.05-0.08
- Profile with MuJoCo profiler to identify bottleneck
- Check for other performance issues (unrelated to collision)

### Issue: "Invisible hitbox" still present

**Check**:
1. Verify you're using the correct XML: `so101_new_calib.xml` (not the backup)
2. Confirm collision files exist: `ls assets/collision/*.stl` (should show 24 files)
3. Reload the model in your application
4. View in `mjpython scripts/view_fixed_collision.py` to verify hulls are loaded

- ✅ Eliminates the "invisible hitbox" issue
- ✅ Provides solid, predictable contacts
- ✅ Improves grasping performance
- ✅ Maintains computational efficiency
- ✅ Is production-ready and integrated into LeRobot

**Current Status**: The fix is active in `so101_new_calib.xml` and requires no code changes to use.

## How to Use

### Standard Usage

The convex decomposition fix is already integrated into `so101_new_calib.xml`. **No code changes needed** - LeRobot will automatically use the improved collision geometry.

### View Collision Geometry

To inspect the decomposed collision hulls:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
mjpython scripts/view_fixed_collision.py
```

In the MuJoCo viewer:
1. Right-click to open menu
2. Enable "Geom group 3" (collision)
3. Enable "Geom group 2" (visual)
4. Enable "Transparent" to overlay and verify tight fit

### Revert to Original (Not Recommended)

If needed for debugging, restore the original mesh-based collision:

```bash
cp so101_new_calib_BACKUP_original_mesh_collision.xml so101_new_calib.xml
```

Note: This will restore the "invisible hitbox" and "mushy contacts" issues.

### Regenerate with Different Parameters

To create a new decomposition with different quality settings:

1. Edit parameters in `scripts/fix_gripper_collision.py`:
   - `threshold`: 0.01-0.1 (lower = tighter fit, more hulls)
   - `max_convex_hull`: 8-20 (higher = more hulls, better accuracy)

2. Run regeneration:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/fix_gripper_collision.py
```

This will regenerate:
- `assets/collision/*.stl` (24 hull meshes)
- `so101_new_calib_fixed_collision.xml` (updated XML)

3. Test and apply if satisfied:
```bash
cp gym-hil/gym_hil/assets/SO101/so101_new_calib_fixed_collision.xml \
   gym-hil/gym_hil/assets/SO101/so101_new_calib.xml
```

## Verification

### Expected Behavior

After the convex decomposition fix, you should observe:

✅ **Tight collision bounds** - collision geometry closely matches visible robot
✅ **Solid contacts** - objects make firm contact with gripper (no penetration)
✅ **No "skin"** - collision geometry is invisible during normal rendering
✅ **Stable physics** - smooth motion, no jitter or solver errors
✅ **Better grasping** - predictable and reliable pick-and-place

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Gripper collision hulls fit visual geometry (verified in viewer)
- [x] No large empty volumes in collision bounds
- [x] Objects make solid contact with gripper
- [x] No visible "skin" around robot (rgba attributes removed)
- [x] Physics simulation stable
- [x] Integrated into LeRobot SO-101 setup

### Visualize and Verify

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
mjpython scripts/view_fixed_collision.py
```

This will:
- Load the robot with decomposed collision geometry
- Allow inspection of collision hulls (group 3)
- Show overlay with visual geometry (group 2)
- Confirm tight fit and no large empty volumes
